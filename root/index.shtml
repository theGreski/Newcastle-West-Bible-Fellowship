            <p>We've made it our priority to make you feel welcome, comfortable and loved. Having an idea of what to expect can help.</p>
            <p>Newcastle West Bible Fellowship is made of ordinary people who worship an extraordinary God. As followers of Jesus we seek to know the Love of God, Learn of Him, and Live a life committed to serving Him and others.</p>
            <p>People from all walks of life are welcome here, regardless of where they are in their spiritual journey.</p>
            <p>Our Bible Preaching starts at either 11:30am on Sundays at North Quay in Newcastle West, Co. Limerick. Come a few minutes early and grab a cup of tea or coffee. If you have kids, just ask one of our greeters for information on avaliable activities.</p>
			
			<!-- COVID note -->
			<!--<p class="text-uppercase lead">Due to the Covid-19 situation, all of the Public meetings and Coffee morning at NCW Bible Fellowship are currently suspended until further notice.</p>-->
			<!--<p>
				As a nation we have all been affected by the current covid-19 emergency. Almost overnight 
				our lives were changed, and many people have been left with what they feel is an uncertain 
				future. Fear and anxiety are prevalent in our society and people are wondering where to turn 
				to for the answers to some of life's questions. When life gets rough &hellip; really ROUGH, and 
				when human help isn't enough where do you turn? There really are only a few options - You 
				can pretend it will be ok, you can drown in despair or you can find real and certain hope. We 
				believe that God's word, the Bible is as real and relevant today as it has always been and 
				brings a message of hope and good news to a hurting world. This hope is not in material 
				things or a religion or church but in a person, Jesus Christ.
			</p>
			<p>Although we are currently closed for Public meetings the church is still functioning and if we can be of any assistance to you, if we can pray for you or if you would like to receive a free Bible please get in touch with us.</p>

                We believe God is doing something special at Newcastle West Bible Fellowship, and we want you to be a part of it.</p>
            <p><strong>Come as you are.</strong> At Newcastle West Bible Fellowship, we deal in real-life, not make-believe, so there is no room for spiritual superiority or reputation building. Just come as you are, because nobody here is perfectâ€”and hopefully, nobody pretends to be.</p>
            <p><strong>Get connected.</strong> No one should face real-life alone. Sometimes life comes in the form of joy and happiness; other times it comes in pain and suffering. No matter your season in life, our desire is to help you create your own community. While we can't make friends for you, we can help you, and your family, connect. We offer many ways to help you engage with others.</p> 
            <p><strong>Serve.</strong> You were created on purpose, with purpose, by a God who thinks your life is way too important to let you spend it all on yourself. Our desire is to help you discover and develop your life's purpose by offering you opportunities to serve and connect. Whether you are people-oriented or task-oriented, introverted or extroverted, a long-term Christ follower or just checking God out, we have something for you.</p>
