            <p class="lead mt-5">Going to a new place for this first time can be challenging. Let us make you feel welcome!</p>
            
            <p>We’ve made it our priority to make you feel welcome, comfortable and loved. Having an idea of what to expect can help.</p>
            <p class="text-3-custom text-center mt-4"><strong>Welcome to Newcastle West Bible Fellowship</strong></p>
            <p>Newcastle West Bible Fellowship is made of ordinary people who worship an extraordinary God. As followers of Jesus we seek to know the Love of God, Learn of Him, and Live a life committed to serving Him and others.</p>
            <p>People from all walks of life are welcome here, regardless of where they are in their spiritual journey.</p>
            
            <p class="text-3-custom text-center mt-4"><strong>What to Expect</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>What's It Like</strong> - Our worship services are all about Jesus, and we worship Him through many expressions. From studying the Word of God, singing, music, prayer and breaking bread together, the whole service is focused on worshiping Him.</p>
            <p><strong>What's Happening</strong> - Coming through the doors you will be greeted by friendly welcoming people. Don’t worry, they won't hassle you or make you sign up for something. The greeters will answer any questions you may have, and help direct you to where you are trying to go.</p>
            <p><strong>What Do I Wear</strong> - What do I wear? - Honestly, whatever you want to. Jesus clearly teaches to come to Him just as you are. Generally the people here dress casually. It doesn't matter if you prefer suits or sandals, you are welcome here!</p>
            <p><strong>What about kids</strong> - We love kids. We love them so much that we have a special service designed just for them. Our desire is to help parents raise kids who love Jesus. When you come, just ask one of our greeters at the door for information on where to take them.</p>
            <p><strong>What time</strong> - That really depends on you. We enjoy the conversation and connection before and after each service, and would like to get to know you as well. If you have kids, then we suggest that you come at least 20 minutes before the start time.</p>
